# TODO

* catch error cases in pkglist.d files, i.e. write test cases
  (this will come once we have more experience with different
  scenarios)

* maybe generate a package list from an installed system with
  the aim to clone a development system into production

* aptitude clean at the end of aptitude-robot-session with a
  flag to switch this off
  maybe APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval of apt is enough

* replace session mail by a generic command that gets the
  session log as stdin
