# TODO

* aptitude-robot should use its own apt.conf.d
* catch error cases in pkglist.d files
* create Debian package
  * including a typical cron job
  * empty package list (i.e. full-upgrade as default)
* option --force-install to ignore all keep (:) and hold (=) requests
  used for the first installation of a system

* maybe generate a package list from an installed system
