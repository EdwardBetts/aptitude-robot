# aptitude-robot should also be installable and usable on older, but
# still supported releases of Debian and Ubuntu, i.e. this override
# and the upstart configuration file may be removed earliest when
# Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trusty", the last Ubuntu LTS release with Upstart
# by default, goes EoL in April 2019. Debian 8 Jessie also supports
# Upstart as alternative, non-default init system and its LTS variant
# goes EoL approximately in June 2020. So it might be useful to keep
# the override and file until then.
