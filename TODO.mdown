# TODO

* catch error cases in pkglist.d files

* maybe generate a package list from an installed system

* deal with non-interactive configuration of packages
  i.e., set options so that debconf does not call dialog

* aptitude clean at the end of aptitude-robot-session with a
  flag to switch this off
